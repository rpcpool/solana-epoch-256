Scripts and Data Related to Solana Epoch 256.

I am looking for correlations between cluster throughput and skipped slots.
This repository contains some script and data files. If have data, scripts,
charts, or anything else to contribute, contact Brian Long for write
permissions.

- solana-block-production.rb -- a quick script to create a CSV file with skipped slot data.
- solana-block-transaction.rb -- a script to pull block data from RPC, count the number of transactions, and create a CSV file.
- solana-epoch-256.xls -- an Excel spreadsheet to get a quick look at some data.

This entire repo is work-in-process. Please help if you can!
